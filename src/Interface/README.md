PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    Create an interface stack. Implement stack in two different classes. First class handles stack
    operation without constraint. Second class handles with constraint.
    
EXPECTED OUTPUT/RESULTS:
    With constraints
    Enter the elements to be inserted: 1 2 3
    Pop : 3 2 1
    Without constraints
    Enter the elements to be inserted: 1
    Enter 0 to exit
    4
    Next element: 2
    Enter 0 to exit
    0
    Pop: 2 1
